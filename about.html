        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>Hi, I’m Giuliano — a maths tutor with over a decade of experience and a passion for helping students unlock their potential. My journey began while studying Mathematics at the University of East Anglia, where I first discovered the power of one-to-one teaching.</p>

                <p>During that time, I worked with a charity that helped children with their schoolwork. This was where I first saw the life-changing impact that one-to-one teaching can have.</p>

                <p>One of my first students was a quiet Year 9 boy who was failing every maths test. After six months of working together, he passed with flying colours.</p>

                <p>Seeing his face light up when he got his results confirmed my mission — to help students discover what they are truly capable of.</p>

                <p>In 2020, I started the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GGMaths" target="_blank">GG Maths YouTube channel</a> to help ambitious students prepare for Olympiad-level challenges and advanced problem-solving.  
                Since then, the channel has grown to over 4,200 subscribers and 260,000+ views, reaching students all over the world.</p>

                <p>Over the past ten years, that mission has continued to grow.</p>

                <p>What started as just me tutoring has now become a small, hand-picked team of highly qualified maths tutors. Each one shares my passion for helping students succeed.</p>

                <p>Today, GG Maths is a team of experts providing high-quality, personalised maths tuition to students all across the UK.</p>
