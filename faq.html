          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How are lessons delivered?</summary>
            <p>All lessons are delivered 1:1 online via Google Meet using interactive whiteboards, so your child can see worked examples in real-time and share their own solutions.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What subjects and levels do you teach?</summary>
            <p>We specialise in maths for ages 7–18, covering Primary, GCSE (Foundation & Higher), and A-Level, across all major UK exam boards.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you offer group lessons?</summary>
            <p>Our focus is on 1:1 tuition, but in certain cases we can arrange small group sessions for siblings or friends who are at a similar level.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How flexible is scheduling?</summary>
            <p>We’ll find a regular time that works for you, and if things change, we’re happy to reschedule when possible. Our goal is to make tutoring fit easily around school and family life.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you offer a trial lesson?</summary>
            <p>Yes — every student starts with a free trial lesson. This gives families a chance to meet the tutor, experience our style, and decide if it’s the right fit before committing.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What equipment does my child need?</summary>
            <p>All that’s required is a computer or tablet with internet access. We’ll guide you through setup and provide links to our resources. A headset or quiet workspace is recommended for the best experience.</p>

        <h2>Results & Approach</h2>
        <div class="faq-list">
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How quickly will my child improve?</summary>
            <p>Many students see a jump of 1–2 grades in just a few months, and 2–4 grades over a year. The exact progress depends on consistent attendance, practice, and engagement. We set clear milestones so you’ll always know how your child is improving.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What makes GG Maths different from other tutors?</summary>
            <p>We go beyond just “turning up and teaching.” Our tutors are hand-picked, highly qualified, and personally trained by Giuliano to deliver structured, engaging lessons. Every student gets a personalised plan, access to exclusive resources, and support that continues between lessons.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can students message tutors between lessons?</summary>
            <p>Yes! If your child is stuck or needs help during the week, they can message their tutor and usually get a response within 24 hours. Support doesn’t stop when the lesson ends.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>My child lacks confidence – can you help?</summary>
            <p>Absolutely. Many students join GG Maths feeling uncertain about their abilities. We focus on building confidence step by step, celebrating progress, and creating a safe environment where mistakes are part of learning. Over time, students go from saying “I can’t do maths” to “I can do this.”</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How are tutors trained?</summary>
            <p>Every GG Maths tutor is carefully selected and personally trained by Giuliano. They all follow our proven, systematic approach while also bringing their own strengths and personality to lessons. Ongoing support ensures consistency across the team.</p>
