Some students freeze when they see a tricky algebra question and donâ€™t know where to begin.  
A simple trick is to **start from the basics** and list everything you know.

## Example Question

*Prove that a shape with angles* $12x+34$, $7x-6$, $15x$, *and* $8x-4$ *is a trapezium.* **(5 marks)**

---

## Step 1: What Do We Know About Trapeziums?

- A trapezium has **four angles**.
- The sum of the interior angles is **$360^\circ$**.
- It has exactly **one pair of parallel sides**.

Add the four angles and set equal to $360$:

$$
(12x+34) + (7x-6) + (15x) + (8x-4) = 360
$$

---

## Step 2: Solve for $x$

Collect like terms:

- $x$ terms: $12x + 7x + 15x + 8x = 42x$
- Numbers: $34 - 6 - 4 = 24$

So we get:

$$
42x + 24 = 360
$$

Subtract $24$ from both sides:

$$
42x = 336
$$

Divide by $42$:

$$
x = 8
$$

---

## Step 3: Find the Angles

Substitute $x=8$:

$$
12(8)+34=130^\circ \quad 7(8)-6=50^\circ
$$
$$
15(8)=120^\circ \quad 8(8)-4=60^\circ
$$

The four angles are: **$130^\circ$, $50^\circ$, $120^\circ$, $60^\circ$**.

---

## Step 4: Check for Parallel Sides

Co-interior (C-shape) angles on parallel lines add to $180^\circ$:

$$
130^\circ + 50^\circ = 180^\circ
$$
$$
120^\circ + 60^\circ = 180^\circ
$$

We have two pairs that sum to $180^\circ$, so the shape has one pair of parallel sides â€” itâ€™s a **trapezium**. âœ…

## Conclusion

If youâ€™re stuck, donâ€™t panic. Start with the basics:

- âœ… Write down known properties (angles, sums, parallel lines).
- âœ… Set up the equation(s) that must hold.
- âœ… Solve step by step and check with a property (like co-interior angles).

Breaking problems down like this makes hard questions much easier. Try it next time! ðŸ’¡
